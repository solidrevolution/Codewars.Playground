## Lessons learned

my first attempt involved creating temporary arrays
as the input gets bigger memory consumption of the functions will increase exponentially.

[ ] it should be possible to optimize the functions so that they do not use tmp arrays.
[ ] also the sort performance is a big factor here do calculations with different data
